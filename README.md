# Research project template

This is a template for research projects.

Fill in sections [Introduction](#introduction), [Related work](#related-work), [Methods](#methods), and [Experiments](#experiments) before writing any code/running any experiments.

If you use this template, please include a link to the [license](https://github.com/jakelevi1996/retempl/blob/main/LICENSE), for example by including the following Markdown snippet:

Significant credit is due to my PhD supervisor [Professor Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/) for encouraging me to internalise these thought processes.

Credit is also due to an old [Tweet](https://x.com/AdrianoAguzzi/status/1806250517204463930) from [@AdrianoAguzzi](https://x.com/AdrianoAguzzi) explaining what a good [Discussion](#discussion) section looks like (although that Tweet appears to no longer exist, so it's good that I took notes).

Before asking any [research questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_question), it is sensible to do some research about [what makes a *good* research question](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/the-research-process/research-question/). For example, a research question should be `focused`, `specific`, `complex`, `feasible`, and `important` to you and others.

A popular framework for goal-setting in general (which is relevant to asking research questions) is [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria), which recommends that a goal should be `specific`, `measurable`, `achievable`, `relevant`, and `time-bound`.

[Megan A. K. Peters](https://sites.google.com/site/meganakpeters) wrote an article in Nature Human Behaviour called [How to develop good research questions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02292-5), arguing that the common adjectives `clear`, `focused`, `relevant`, `novel` and `tractable` are insufficient, and that research questions should be driven by enthusiasm, through a process containing 4 phases and 4 traps:

- Phases:
  - Phase 1: a self-critical brainstorm
  - Phase 2: building context and connections
  - Phase 3: distilling to the essence
  - Phase 4: the final product
- Traps:
  - Trap 1: the ‘hypothesis requirement’
  - Trap 2: excessive attachment to your question(s)
  - Trap 3: ‘oh no, someone already had my idea!’
  - Trap 4: the ‘hammer and nail’ trap
